James, Ben's soon to be brother-in-law, is still annoyed by his tactics. Ben is about to get married to James' sister Angela, but their boss Lt. Brooks assigns them on a huge case that is in Miami, where they will be working with the Miami Police Department in order to bring down a powerful drug lord named Antonio Pope.</p>
