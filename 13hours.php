    <p class="abstract">On the evening of September 11, 2012, the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, a group of Islamist militants attack the American diplomatic compound and a nearby CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya. CIA security contractors - military veterans who served with the Navy SEALS, Marine Corps and Army Special Forces - take the initiative to make a desperate stand to defend the American Ambassador and his staff within the diplomatic compound.</p>
